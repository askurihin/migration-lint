# Welcome to **migration-lint**

`migration-lint` is the modular linter tool designed
to perform checks on database schema migrations
and prevent unsafe operations.

Features:

- Works with [Django migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/),
  [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) and raw sql files.
- Easily extensible for other frameworks.
- Can identify Backward Incompatible operations
  and check if they are allowed in the current context.
- Can identify "unsafe" operations, e.g. operations that acquire locks
  that can be dangerous for production database.

## Installation

```shell linenums="0"
poetry add "migration-lint"
```

```shell linenums="0"
pip install "migration-lint"
```

## Terms

- **Source loader** (or just loader) - class that loads list of changed files.
- **Extractor** - class that extracts SQL by migration name,
  so it depends on the framework you use for migrations.
- **Linter** - class that checks migration's SQL and context
  and returns errors if any. We have implemented our linter
  for backward incompatible migrations as well as integrated `squawk` linter.

## Run

### Local

If you need to check local git changes (for example before commit):

```shell linenums="0"
migration-lint --loader=local_git --extractor=<your extractor>
```

It will examine files in current repository that are added or modified
and not yet commited.

If you need to check all committed changes in the current branch compared to
master/main branch (configurable with `CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH`):

```shell linenums="0"
migration-lint --loader=local_git_branch --extractor=<your extractor>
```

### GitLab

If you need to run it on the GitLab pipeline:

```shell linenums="0"
migration-lint --loader=gitlab_branch --extractor=<your extractor>
```

It relies on default GitLab [environment variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html),
namely CI_PROJECT_ID, CI_COMMIT_BRANCH.
You also should issue a token with read permissions
and put it into env variable CI_DEPLOY_GITLAB_TOKEN.

Also, these parameters can be passed via options:

```shell linenums="0"
migration-lint --loader=gitlab_branch --extractor=<your extractor>
--project-id=<proj id> --branch=<branch> --gitlab-api-key=<key>
```

Also, version for Merge Requests is available:

```shell linenums="0"
migration-lint --loader=gitlab_branch --extractor=<your extractor>
```

I uses env variable CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID or option --mr-id.
